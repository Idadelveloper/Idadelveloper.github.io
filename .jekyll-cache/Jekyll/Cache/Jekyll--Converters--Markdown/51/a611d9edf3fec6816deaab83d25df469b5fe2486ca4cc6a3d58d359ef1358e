<p>I quite remember how happy and excited I was on November 23rd when I got the internship. It was almost like a dream. Little did I know the struggles and frustrations that await me.</p>

<p>Before the intern announcement day, I already started doing my little research and since I was to enhance the Yocto Projectâ€™s license tracing, I started reading about licenses, license compliance, and anything related to open source licensing in general. Truth be told I had no idea about open source licenses before this internship but now Iâ€™m considering being an open-source lawyerâ€¦lol</p>

<p>So my project comprises 4 tasks of which the first is to take a certain proof of concept and get it to a stage where it can be merged to the main branch of the repository. I had no clue what I was supposed to do and had to ask one of my mentors. He gave me a series of steps on how I will accomplish this and everything was centered around improving the performance. Certain warnings will show up when running a build and I was asked to make these warnings optional. It was not easy knowing where exactly in the whole codebase I was supposed to make changes and it took a while before finding where. After that, I was so excited. I thought I already finished my first task so soon but there was moreâ€¦
I was asked to get the build statistics when I try running another build with the changes I made and compare them with the previous state. For close to a week I did not do any actual work or made any progress. I was just googling stuff back and forth with no helpful results. It was until I got back to my mentor and made him understand how stuck I am before I got a real solution to my problem.</p>

<p>To conclude this write up, all I can say is develop the habit of asking for help when you are stuck. It will save you a lot of time. Also, do not be too hard on yourself. Make sure to maintain a healthy lifestyle and get some rest when stressed. Sometimes maybe the reason you canâ€™t figure things out is that you are tired or hungry. Lastly, never doubt yourself. If you can make it this far then you definitely can accomplish your project.</p>
