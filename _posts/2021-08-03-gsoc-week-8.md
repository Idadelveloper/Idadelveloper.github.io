The 8th week started with me trying to figure out why Windows and FreeBSD were giving me a headache. During the weekly meetings on Wednesdays, I mentioned the problem which led to my mentors suggesting I try building clang-format using the RTEMS source builder. I haven't been quite successful with that though. Encountered a bunch of errors I can't seem to find a solution to any. I decided to go back and readdress the compatibility issue I am facing.


Firstly, I thought something was wrong with my code. I thought I did not make use of Python's subprocess module correctly (don't know why I will think of that if it worked well with Linux). No matter what I did the output I got from the pre-commit hook on Windows was not right. Though I had FreeBSD set up and everything installed I was yet to test it. I was confident it will work on FreeBSD so I just channeled all my energy trying to sort out Windows. I got tired and moved to FreeBSD. I got shocked when I  had the same results as with Windows. I was in denial. I just couldn't imagine I will go through the same stress with FreeBSD. But that only gave me a clue into what the actual problem was. This only meant there was something Linux had that both FreeBSD and Windows didn't reason why only Linux produces the expected output. I later realized I was making use of the `clang-format-diff` command which comes alongside clang-format in Linux. I manually checked the `/usr/bin/` folder and saw it there. As for FreeBSD it was nowhere to be found. I could find `clang`, `clang-format`, and others in the folder but nothing like clang-format diff. That was my big "A-HA!" moment. That command was missing in FreeBSD. I started looking into how I could get the command installed into FreeBSD but found nothing. I then decided I will find a way and just stick only to the clang-format command to avoid cross-compatibility problems. After that, I moved back to my `rtems-tools` script.


About the script, I will say I am about 60% done. It is a command which can accept arguments to either check for style differences or reformat code determined by the `check` or `reformat` mode on a file or a directory. The script works perfectly when I pass in a file but the output I get for a directory looks off. I did not see this coming at all. I am looking forward to trying to fixing that in the 9th week though I am already getting frustrated. At least it produces the same results on both Windows and FreeBSD.
