So it was the evening of May 17th, 2021. I was expecting the GSoC results on that day but they came earlier than I expected. I was going through my email and then I saw a message from Google Summer of Code. Onsight of it I got the jitters. I already knew I will get it though. But there’s this joyous feeling that comes at the sight of an acceptance email. And there it was – “Hi Ida Delphine, your proposal Code Formatting and Style Check for RTEMS SuperCore has been accepted! Welcome to GSoC 2021!”

# So what is GSoC?
[GSoC or Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/about/) is an annual summer internship program for students and recent graduates where they spend their summer contributing code to open source organizations. In addition, they get a stipend ranging from 1500-3000 dollars based on your location. How cool is that?


# So how did I get selected?
Getting the GSoC internship could be quite a struggle especially for a newbie that isn’t familiar with open source. But if you are a bit skilled in at least a programming language, willing to learn, and know the basics of opensource/contributing to opensource, then you’re good to go!
It all started on March 9th, 2021 when GSoC organizations were announced. I immediately rushed to the GSoC site scouting for organizations so that I could start contributing ASAP. Considering the fact that I was previously an [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) intern with the [Yocto Project](https://idadelveloper.github.io/blog/2021/01/11/my-audience) which has got a lot to do with embedded and operating systems, I thought it will be cool if I just focus on the embedded space reason why I picked the [RTEMS Project](https://www.rtems.org/). RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is a free real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for deeply embedded systems such as automobile electronics, robotic controllers, and onboard satellite instruments. Finding my way around the community was not easy from the start. But the first thing I did was join their mailing lists and IRC and introduced myself. The community was welcoming; one of the reasons I just focused on it and didn’t submit any other proposal elsewhere. I began reading the documentation and in 5 days I submitted my first [contribution](https://git.rtems.org/rtems-docs/log/?qt=author&q=Ida+Delphine) which was instantly merged. Cool right? I know! Lol.


So I had exams coming up but I didn’t want that to stop me. I made some more contributions before going on a short break...kinda to leave my mark and make things look like I am around ;-)
I later went to their issue tracker and there were a bunch of proposed GSoC projects there already. Since I mentioned I am proficient in Python my mentor had already suggested a Python project for me. I later developed my proposal and applied via the GSoC website. After the application deadline, I stuck around asking questions on the mailing list about my project. I was already confident it’s mine. Fast forward and now I’m officially a GSoC intern!


# What are the benefits?
Apart from the stipend which is really attractive, there’s more to this. You have the opportunity to improve your skills by contributing to a huge codebase under the mentorship of an experienced developer. Just from my few days going through the RTEMS documentation, I learned a lot. What I wouldn’t get from the classroom or just by merely self-teaching. Also, you will get to network with a community of like-minded interns from a diverse set of backgrounds. If this doesn’t motivate you then the stipend should :)


# What next?
Well, we’ll see. The fact thy internship will be over by August won’t stop me from contributing to open source. Open source is amazing and I will never stop contributing to it. Never!!!



_In case you’re looking forward to get into GSoC next year or just get into open source, follow these tips..._


## Tips on getting started
- Pick a path (could be web development, mobile app development, data science, etc)
- Pick at least one object-oriented programming language and be proficient in it.
- Learn Git and GitHub.
- Learn algorithms and the Big-O (often neglected but important)


## Tips on contributing to open source projects
- Join their public chats (mailing list, IRC, slack, gitter, discord, etc)
- Read the documentation README file of the repository.
- Ask questions after doing your own personal research.
- Start by picking small issues and try to fix them before moving to more difficult ones.
- Follow the contribution guidelines of the project.
