By the end of the [8th week](https://idadelveloper.github.io/blog/2021/08/03/gsoc-week-8), I had already written the rtems-style script which had some slight issues. I later resolved them and made a push to my GitHub for my mentor to review. He told me for me to successfully write or update RSB(RTEMS Source Builder) scripts, I should have experience building the same software by hand. This kinda crushed me because I remember going through hell to build LLVM from source some time ago and it did not work. This meant I should try again till it works.


Also, during our weekly stand-up, they hinted to me there is already a recipe to build LLVM in the RSB and I should try to build LLVM using the RSB as well. I was kinda excited because I thought this will be less stressful but little did I know what was coming(LOL). I attempted building the tool using the RSB but for some reason, it failed. When this happened I thought I should try building from source again. I re-cloned the LLVM repo and followed the instruction to building it in the docs. It was going smooth but had to fail at almost 90%. it took me a while to find out it was a result of insufficient resources. I kept running out of memory. 


I bounced back to building LLVM with the RSB and it kept failing. After a couple of discussions on Discord, I realized the error was due to a missing patch. My mentor sent me a link to the patch which I applied by hand hoping it will resolve the issue but unfortunately, it didn't. It landed me another error different from the previous one. I guess there was a problem with that version of LLVM. Anyways my mentor told me to try building the latest version. Exactly what I had tried building and it failed before I moved to build with the RSB. Well, I had no choice but to find a way. I later discovered the problem was that I was building using `make` and that's why I kept running out of resources. I tried building with `ninja` and it went great!! This got me excited. I could not believe it. I feel like I should remove LLVM from my system and rebuild it again just to be sure that it worked.


After that, I went back to working on my code. My mentos suggested I try to make use of some of the modules in the `rtemstoolkit` or `rtems-tools` like `check.py` and `execute.py`. That was another struggle but after a while, I was able to apply them to my code and sent them to my mentor for more review. The 10th week is the last week of coding and honestly, I am so scared. I hope I submit my code and even if I don't succeed, I believe I learned a lot.
