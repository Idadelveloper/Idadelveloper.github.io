So the first month of the internship has pretty much been about the pre-commit hook script. I started the 5th week looking into my next task which is adding a standalone tool to rtems-tools.git which can run over rtems.git checking for style issues and produce a report about these issues. I started by going through the docs and checking what rtems-tools is all about. After that, I tried building and testing it. I then started looking at the code and somehow I got lost. I was trying to figure out where in the code I was to include the script though I was yet to write it.


I had to seek help in the community on a way forward and I started a conversation with one of the RTEMS GSoC mentors that are also in charge of maintaining the rtems-tools repository. He gave me a little briefing of what rtems-tools is all about and stressed on me making sure my code works in both python 2 and 3 and eliminating dependencies. He made it clear the script I am to write will pretty much function as a command and named it rtems-style. This command will work in two modes of which one will be to only check for style differences while the other will reformat the given file or directory. 


Later, he started looking into my pre-commit hook script and gave me some suggestions to make it work better. The rtems-tools script I am to add will work almost like the pre-commit hook script so he suggested I move that functionality to rtems-tools and let the pre-commit work like a mode. I am still a little confused about that but will figure it out.  Also, about the pre-commit, he hinted to me it might not work great on FreeBSD as it works on Linux. FreeBSD is one of the few hosts I have to make sure my code is compatible with. I spent the weekend trying to install FreeBSD and get it running on a virtual machine which has not been successful due to connectivity issues and also because it is my first time. Looking forward to finishing installing it soon. I thought I should test the pre-commit hook script on Windows and it works partially well. The commit aborts but it does not list the files and number of affected files. Didn't see that coming but working on fixing that. In the meantime, my biggest issue is having FreeBSD up and running. I also started working on the rtems-tools script. Hopefully, by next week, I should have succeeded in getting FreeBSD to test my code.
