The [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) is an open-source collaboration project that helps developers create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products, regardless of the hardware architecture. It provides a flexible set of tools and space where embedded developers worldwide can share technologies, software stacks, configurations, and best practices to create tailored Linux images for embedded and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Ok, I know this sounds a little complicated. Let me simplify it.

It is a build system for Linux distributions, primarily for the embedded market. That means it is being used to compile for example the software package that is being run in a fancy coffee maker. Now everything is published under a certain license. The YP already has some means of tracing the licenses, to make sure only the intended things go into the released software package. To come back to the coffee maker example, this means the manufacturer has to provide license texts for parts of it but probably doesn't want to hand out the internals of the actual company software, as it might contain intellectual property about the electronics being used, or outstanding knowledge about brewing.

If you want to make contributions to this amazing project, you will find their repository at [https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky](https://git.yoctoproject.org/git/poky). Before making any contributions, be sure to check the README in the repository you're making changes to for additional contribution instructions. Also, make sure you subscribe to the mailing list-[lists.yoctoproject.org](https://lists.yoctoproject.org/g/yocto). You make contributions to this project by submitting patches via email. Read more about patch submission [here](https://www.openembedded.org/wiki/How_to_submit_a_patch_to_OpenEmbedded). Feel free to ask your questions on the mailing list or the IRC public chat on [freenode](http://freenode.net/) and go to #yocto. It’s made up of hundreds of amazing developers more than willing to help.

Hope you understood what the Yocto Project is all about and I’m looking forward to having you join the community :)
