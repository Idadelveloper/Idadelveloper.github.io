Week 6 was quite frustrating and I thought all my issues will be resolved by the 7th week but that wasn't the case at all!! Though I will say compared to the previous week there is some progress.


About last week I was having issues with installing FreeBSD into my virtual machine which took a lot of my time. I realized my code won't be compatible with other RTEMS hosts and was quite anxious to get FreeBSD and test it out but everything just seemed to be against me. After a couple of days, I got FreeBSD into my virtual machine which worked great. Finally, I could feed in my curiosity into knowing what made my code incompatible with FreeBSD and I did find out a lot of things.


I realized the steps I was supposed to take just to get the script up and running were quite different compared to Linux. Also, I had to set the shebang to `#! usr/local/bin/python` whereas for Linux we had `#! usr/bin/python`. Another thing was the fact that, unlike Linux, clang-format automatically executes without the version number attached to the command but that's not the case with FreeBSD. I also ran the code on Windows and the results were not looking great. Since last week I have been trying to resolve the problem I have with the output from Windows. The script actually runs and the commit aborts when necessary but it does not display the output on the terminal. Not forgetting the steps I followed just to install clang-format on windows. I had to install node before downloading clang-format via npm (will have to include that in the documentation). I thought having it work on Windows will be the least of my worries but things always just happen to turn out the way I least expect.
 
 
Since I am to write another script for rtems-tools.git which will incorporate the pre-commit hook script, I tried having the hook script run on other hosts so that I will know how to make the script for rtems-tools more compatible with the other hosts. I am almost done with this new script and have run it on Linux which seems to work well. At least I made some progress! I'm yet to try it out on Windows and FreeBSD but I know it will be tough on me to get it to work properly on these other hosts. I am also supposed to make sure the code supports both Python 2 and Python 3.


I really hope around the beginning of August I should have my code ready for review. My goal for the 8th week is to have the code ready for review and get it to work properly on the other hosts. Time is not on my side!!!
