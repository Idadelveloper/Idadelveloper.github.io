The second week of my GSoC internship has been quite an experience and very interesting. I finally started writing some actual code. I mean, the "code" in Google Summer of Code isn't there for fancy.

I started with writing a git pre-commit hook script. I remember some months back when one of my mentors suggested I write a git commit hooks script when I was still making inquiries about my project. I had no clue about what git hooks were back then. I had to go look it up found a whole new part of git I could never imagine. Git is just so broad; every single month I keep discovering new things.

So what I did was I wrote a script that checks on style differences when a user wants to commit a patch. First and foremost, I had to read some documentation to understand how to write a pre-commit hook.
In my _.git/hooks/pre-commit_ file, the first thing I did was to set up my shebang line ```(#!/usr/bin/python)``` such that my script will be interpreted in Python. Next, I had to find the right command to format patches and finally used this:
```
git diff -U0 --no-color --staged  HEAD --$dir_list | clang-format-diff -p1 -style=file
```
I passed this command into Python's _subprocess.Popen()_ method so that it can run the command directly from the script and captured the output in a variable. So technically it does not affect the file the patch is in. The output is simply the diff upon running the patch with clang-format-diff. In case the style matches, then there will be no diff hence no output. If there are any differences in the style of the patch, the captured output will contain the diff which also shows what the patch will look like when formatted. That's pretty much the logic I used.

Therefore, upon committing, if there are any style differences, the commit aborts, and the captured output is printed on the terminal. If otherwise, the commit happens. I felt proud when I was able to make this work.  I mean, I'm still new to git hooks. So I went to the RTEMS developers mailing list and showed them what I did requesting some feedback. Here's a screenshot of how the output looked like before I went asking for suggestions on the mailing list.

I got a few suggestions. From the output above you will notice everything is just plain and could be quite difficult going through it especially trying to look at what the patch looks like before and after formatting. So one of the suggestions was I try to add a little bit of color so that the differences can easily be pointed out. I had no clue how I will achieve that but it looked like fun. I love playing with colors. I later got another suggestion stating I make the display of the style differences optional - like come up with different modes as far as the committing is concerned. Also, I should be able to include the number of style differences which should come out as a warning and there should also be a way to override the commit being aborted. I had to go back and make some improvements.



The first thing I did was to figure out the logic of the different modes. This was quite a challenge because I could not find anything on how to pass arguments to a hooks script. I managed to find one stack overflow answer which made mention of using environment variables and I decided to go with it. Afterward, I started finding out how to print out colored text on the terminal. This part of the work was really fun for me. It was also tricky for me to figure out the right colors. Anyways I was able to do everything before the weekend ran out.



About the modifications I did I've made sure there are 3 modes. We have the default, strict and non-strict mode (could not think of cooler names for the modes).

* **Default mode:** This occurs upon running:
```
git commit -m "commit message"
```
It pretty much checks for style differences and prints out a warning containing the number of style issues. It also displays an error message and the commit aborts.

* **Strict mode:** To trigger this mode, your command should look like this (you can see I had to make use of environment variables):
```
STYLEMODE=strict git commit -m "Commit message"
```
It checks for style differences and goes into a little more detail by printing out what the patch looks like before and after formatting. Notice how you can easily differentiate what is what? ;-)

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="/assets/images/strict-mode2.png" class="rounded w-50 mb-10" alt="RTEMS logo">
</div>



* **Non-strict mode:** This mode should be used when you want to still check for style differences and know if there is anything wrong with the style but the commit does not abort like the other modes. What makes this mode different from when you add the --no-verify option when doing a git commit is this will bypass the pre-commit hook. Hence you won't be aware of style differences when you commit your patch. It is invoked by running:
```
STYLEMODE=nonstrict git commit -m "Commit message"
```

So that's pretty much it about what I did during my second week. I am still to get some more feedback and optimize my code as well. Maybe next week's blog post will be about the changes I made based on more feedback. 



**Next step:** According to my proposal, the script should be able to ignore some files so I will discuss with my mentors about the files to be ignored.


_Thanks for reading and looking forward to doing more this week._
