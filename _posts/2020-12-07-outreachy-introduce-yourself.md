# A Little About Me!
![Ida Delphine's Picture](/assets/images/idadel.jpg "Ida's Pic"){: .center-image }

Hello, I’m Ida Delphine and currently a 20 year old computer engineering student based in Cameroon. I fell in love with coding about a year ago after I wrote my first Python code. Back then, I was in a med school doing pharmacy technology and after my first coding experience, I didn’t even think twice about dropping out from med school. It was not an easy decision but I must say, completely changing my career path to technology has been my best decision so far. A year later after my transition to tech, I got the outreachy internship which is my main reason for this intro.

Regarding the outreachy internship my project is to *Enhance the Yocto Project’s license tracing* and my mentors are [*Paul Eggleton*](https://github.com/bluelightning) and [*Tim Orling*](https://twitter.com/moto_timo).

Oh! Two more things...I love Python and chocolate.

# My Core Values!
My top three core values are compency, honesty and respect. Here's why:

1. **Competency**: It has always been my thing to do stuff efficiently. I wouldn’t call myself a perfectionist but whatever work I need to get done, I make sure I do my absolute best. I don’t think I would have made it to being an outreachy intern if I wasn’t competent.

2. **Honesty**: I value honesty because by being honest and working or interacting with honest people there’s some sense of trust around us which makes the environment more comfortable and encouraging to work in. Also, there are a whole lot of problems in this life that cannot be solved unless one is honest reason why I totally believe in the saying “The truth will set you free”

3. **Respect**: This is one of my core values because it determines how any relationship will look like. Honestly, I can’t work or be be in a setting where I am not respected. I believe people should show regard for the feelings, ideas, rights, etc of others. Nobody deserves to be disrespected or feel disrespected for no good reason. 

# My Application Motivation and Journey!
![Outreachy](/assets/images/outreachyy.png "Outreachy's Pic"){: .center-image }

I knew about [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) about a year ago but I always thought that I am not good enough for this amazing opportunity considering the fact that I transitioned to tech just a year ago. With time I learned about open source development and it was then I knew  I was born for this. I wouldn't know up to half the stuff I know about tech if not for some amazing open source contributors and enthusiasts.


In addition, I was a preacher of actively practicing open source development but I wasn’t consistent and neither was I taking it very seriously. Again, I felt like I wasn’t good enough or maybe I was just lazy. When the initial applications of outreachy was open I got the information through their tweet.  I’ve always wanted to go in for Google Summer of Code but with the competition involved I never tried(not cool of me). So learning outreachy favors girls in tech and no past GsoC interns were allowed was some real great motivation. This was an opportunity I couldn’t miss. At least I thought it wasn’t going to be competitive(it was competitive, lol).


The main motivation that led me to applying for outreachy was the experience I’ll get and how it’s going to help boost my CV. I couldn’t proudly brag of any notable open source project I’ve contributed to but just before I could submit my final application a made a few contributions I am proud of. Also, this was an opportunity for me to network and connect with other experienced developers, learn more about open source best practices, work with an expert mentor and a lot more. Oh, and not forgetting the monthly stipend which will go a long way to assist me especially as the pandemic has slowed things down for my family. All these really gave me that push submit my initial application.


After I submitted my initial application, I immediately went through the projects page to start getting familiar with projects I will love to work on. Then I stumbled upon the [Yocto Project](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.1/yocto-project-qs/yocto-project-qs.html)(YP for short). Unlike Apache, Wikimedia, Mozilla, this was my first time hearing about the Yocto Project and it really caught my attention. I started reading about it and I found it really cool though I didn’t understand much about it. I thought about giving up on it and maybe going to another organization but I chose to challenge myself with this one. I seriously needed the help of someone familiar with the project so that I will be able to understand the basics before the contribution period. For that reason, I went on twitter and followed the [YP](https://twitter.com/yoctoproject). I went through their tweets and I noticed the YP retweeted a lot of tweets from [TheYoctoJester](https://twitter.com/TheYoctoJester). It was then I followed him and politely sent him a DM introducing myself and how I needed help understanding the YP. He was so kind and explained it more to me which and then everything just made sense. After that, he hooked me up with some of the members of the YP community and this just made things a lot easier for me. I remain grateful for his kind gesture.


I realized how amazing and welcoming the community was and with how far I already went, I just had to finish what I already started. Though I didn’t know the details of my project since it wasn’t the contribution period yet, I started doing a little research just so that when the contribution period begins I won’t have to stress much. The contribution period began on October 7th and by October 8th I already started making contributions. I made up to 3 contributions and made sure I was in touch with my mentors even after submitting my final application.


Good for me all my hard work paid off. On November 23th I received an email about being accepted for the internship. It was almost like a dream. If you’re reading this post and you feel like you’re not good enough to make open source contributions or you’re not good enough for anything in general, cancel that mentality. You have to start from somewhere. Even if you apply and don’t get the internship, try again next time. Bear in mind the most difficult part is the contribution period where you have to be chosen among other aspiring interns. Give it your all, make a bunch of quality contributions and have the community spirit.



In general, I’m enjoying my outreachy experience and I particularly encourage people who think they’re beginners or not good enough to apply. You’ll learn a lot trust me :)
