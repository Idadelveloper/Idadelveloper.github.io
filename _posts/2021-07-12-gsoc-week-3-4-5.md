The past weeks have been quite hectic for me as I have had to balance both work and school. I will spend my days at school and nights trying to get some work done. I have not been able to get as much work done because I recently had exams but I’ve done enough to get evaluated for the first half of my internship. I believe I have already done half of my work and will increase my pace these coming weeks.


So the [last post](https://idadelveloper.github.io/blog/2021/05/21/gsoc-week2) was about the progress I made in my pre-commit hook script and it was working quite well. I got some feedback from my mentor and made some changes to the code. The first thing he suggested was to trigger the different modes, it’s better I add options to my local git configuration file instead of using the environment variables. I got a little stuck here because I had to make use of Python’s git module which works with Python 3 but I set my shebang to Python 2. It took me a while to find out that was the reason for the Import and ModuleNotFound errors I kept on getting.


My mentor made more suggestions to improve the look of my code. One was for me to encapsulate my code in functions for better code modularity. Now that I think of it my code was kind of a mess at the beginning though it worked great. Also, there was a lot of repetition between some functions. For example, I had 2 functions – “strict” and “nonStrict”; one seemed to be the copy and pasted version of the other with a few extra lines of code. From the review I learned, I should be keen on certain things like calling a function just once or maybe a few times (if need be) in my entire code. This is something I never really paid much attention to. My focus has always been to make it work! Now I know better :)


After the review, the next thing I was going to was to configure the script to ignore some files since there are some third-party files in the codebase. This was quite a confusing task for me because I had no idea which files or directories for the script to ignore. After a couple of discussions on the RTEMS discord server, I finally went with using the directories ignored by the Coverity analysis. The directories are: ./bsps/, ./testsuites, ./cpukit/mghttpd, ./cpukit/zlib. Maybe later I will add more directories to be ignored by the script.


The next thing I finally did was documenting how the pre-commit hook script worked. You can check out the script [here](https://github.com/Idadelveloper/rtems/blob/master/hooks/pre-commit) and how to use it [here](https://github.com/Idadelveloper/rtems-docs/commit/a30407e159726ce745df7ab4813c5b3a58b34f93). I’ve gotten a suggestion from one of my mentors to add a README.md file to the directory the script is in. That shouldn’t be a problem since I already documented it in rtems-docs earlier. 


Looking back to my [project’s proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VADJh3_kIhs578IEmBJ98rjR6p5E1XcksUkq1Ms4jRA/edit?usp=sharing), I did not exactly follow the project’s timeline. This pre-commit hook script was meant for the second half of the internship. The first task was for me to add a standalone script in rtems-tools.git that can be run over rtems.git which creates a report about style problems. The pre-commit hook script seemed easier and since I had school, I thought I will easily manage it alongside school. While the pre-commit hook script is still undergoing review, this week I’m starting working on the script for rtems-tools.git.
Thanks for reading :)
