So my GSoC internship with the [RTEMS Project](https://www.rtems.org/) officially started on June 7th, 2021 and so far it has been great especially with the welcoming community. My GSoC project is to ensure Automatic Code Formatting and Style checking for RTEMS Score. This is simply to help developers new to RTEMS send patches in the RTEMS coding style and ensure consistency in their codebase. The code “formatter” we decided to go with was clang-format since it is closest to the RTEMS coding style. You can check out my [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VADJh3_kIhs578IEmBJ98rjR6p5E1XcksUkq1Ms4jRA/edit?usp=sharing) to learn more.



How I am to achieve this is by integrating clang-format into RTEMS such that in case a developer wants to commit a patch and the style doesn’t match that of RTEMS, the commit would be aborted with some message telling the developer about the style. Using the git pre-commit hook will pretty much create this functionality.



The first week was not as easy as I thought it was going to be. I spent my time running tests to make sure clang-format wouldn’t cause bugs in the code. Also, I started looking into editing the clang-format in such a way that it would act more like a “checker” than a “formatter” on patches. My target was the clang-format-diff.py file which takes care of patch reformatting. Since I was to do some custom changes to clang-format, that meant I needed to clone and build it from source. I would also have to add a build script to the RTEMS source builder to build clang-format from source. But for a start, I had to build clang from source and honestly, it did not work out well. I kept having memory issues. As a result, I figured I can implement the “checker” functionality in the commit hook.



 This week, I started working on my script for the git pre-commit hook. I’ve managed to put something together and test on the codebase. It seems to be working well but will have to get feedback from the community, improve it and run more tests to be sure there are no hidden bugs. The next thing I plan on doing is to add a standalone script in rtems-tools.git that can be run over the rtems.git which creates a report about style problems.
